What is Context API?

The React Context API is a way for a React app to effectively produce global variables that can be passed around. 
This is the alternative to "prop drilling" or moving props from grandparent to child to parent, and so on.

React.createContext() is all you need. It returns a consumer and a provider. 
Provider is a component that as it's names suggests provides the state to its children.
It will hold the "store" and be the parent of all the components that might need that store.
Consumer as it so happens is a component that consumes and uses the state.

Context API will replace redux?
Redux is great and came perfectly to answer the need for state management.

When using redux people tend to manage almost all of their state in redux and it causes 2 problems:

1.Overhead - Why should I create/update 3 files just to add one tiny feature?

2.One of the significant advantages of React's one-way data binding is that it's easy to understand - A component passes state to its children. 
Using Redux takes it away from us.

Using Context API we can define several unrelated contexts (stores) and use each in its proper place in the app.

How to use Context API?

Create a folder under your app root named contexts (not required. just a convention)
Create a file named <your context name>Context.js, e.g. userContext.js
import and create a context like so:
